## General Info / Purpose
This is a training project/end of week challenge to test understanding of Javascript. We started from scratch with no code and created the HTML shell, CSS files, and Javascript. This challenge not only forced learning of new methods such as setTimeout and setInterval methods, but also dynamically creating and changing elements within javascript.
